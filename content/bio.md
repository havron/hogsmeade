Here is a brief biography suitable for use in brochures, advertisements, media,
etc. The image on this page should be of sufficient resolution for small
printing. My **CV/resume** is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/havron/cv) as
a PDF, current as of latest commit.

# copy/paste this blurb for talks, etc
**Sam Havron is a PhD student in computer science at Cornell University; he is
in residence at Cornell Tech on Roosevelt Island in New York City. 
He currently works on computer
security and privacy issues in the context of intimate partner violence (IPV).
His research has been published at top security conferences such as IEEE S&P, and 
featured by media outlets including the New York Times.
When not staring at metal rectangles full of little lights, 
Sam can often be spotted reading books or exploring new places.**
