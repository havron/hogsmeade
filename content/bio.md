Here is a brief biography suitable for use in brochures, advertisements, media,
etc. The image on this page should be of sufficient resolution for small
printing. My **CV/resume** is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/havron/cv) as
a PDF, current as of latest commit.

# copy/paste this blurb for talks, etc
**Sam Havron is a PhD student in computer science at Cornell University; he is
in residence at Cornell Tech on Roosevelt Island in New York City. 
Sam's research interests include topics in computer security & privacy,
programming languages, applied cryptography, machine learning, 
and interdisciplinary efforts among these areas.
Recently, this has included building systems that preserve the privacy and safety of end-users
while also increasing transparency and responsibility of providers.
When not staring at metal rectangles full of little lights, 
Sam can often be spotted reading books, or biking.**
